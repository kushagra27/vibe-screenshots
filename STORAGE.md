# 💾 Storage Solutions for Screenshot Gallery

## ⚠️ **The Storage Problem**

Most cloud platforms use **ephemeral filesystems** - uploaded files are **deleted on every deployment**!

### What happens without persistent storage:
```
1. Upload screenshots ✅
2. Gallery shows images ✅  
3. Code change triggers redeploy 🔄
4. All uploaded images GONE! ❌
5. Gallery is empty again 😢
```

## 🔧 **Solutions by Platform**

### **Railway**
- **Free Tier:** ❌ No persistent volumes
- **Hobby Plan ($5/mo):** ✅ Add Volume → Mount `/app/source`
- **Pro Plan:** ✅ Multiple volumes supported

### **Render.com**  
- **Free Tier:** ❌ Ephemeral storage only
- **Paid Plans:** ✅ Persistent disks available

### **Fly.io**
- **All Plans:** ✅ Volumes included
- **Setup:** `fly volumes create screenshots --size 1`

## 🚀 **Recommended Solutions**

### **Option 1: Platform Volumes (Easiest)**
```yaml
# Railway: Add Volume in dashboard
Mount Path: /app/source
Size: 1GB+

# Fly.io: fly.toml already configured
[mounts]
  source = "screenshots"
  destination = "/app/source"
```

### **Option 2: External Storage (Production)**
Add cloud storage integration:
- **AWS S3** - Most popular
- **Cloudinary** - Image-focused  
- **Google Cloud Storage** - Good pricing
- **DigitalOcean Spaces** - Simple

### **Option 3: Self-Host (Full Control)**
- **VPS with Docker** - Complete control
- **Traditional hosting** - Shared/dedicated servers
- **Home server** - Your own hardware

## 📊 **Storage Comparison**

| Solution | Setup | Cost | Persistence | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------|------|-------------|------|------|
| **Railway Volume** | Easy | $5/mo | ✅ | Simple, integrated | Requires paid plan |
| **Render Disk** | Easy | $7/mo | ✅ | Free tier available | Limited free storage |
| **Fly Volume** | Medium | $2-5/mo | ✅ | Great performance | Docker knowledge helpful |
| **S3 Storage** | Hard | ~$1/mo | ✅ | Unlimited scale | Complex setup |
| **VPS** | Hard | $5-20/mo | ✅ | Full control | Server management |

## 🎯 **Quick Recommendations**

### **For Beginners:** 
Railway Hobby Plan ($5/mo) with Volume

### **For Developers:**
Fly.io with persistent volume

### **For Production:**
External storage (S3/Cloudinary) + any platform

### **For Budget:**
VPS with Docker deployment

## ⚡ **Immediate Fix for Current Deployment**

If you're already deployed on Railway free tier:

1. **Upgrade to Hobby Plan** ($5/mo)
2. **Add Volume:** Mount path `/app/source`  
3. **Redeploy** - images will now persist!

Or switch to **Fly.io** which includes volumes on all plans.

## 🔮 **Future Enhancement: Cloud Storage**

For production sites, consider adding cloud storage:
- Images stored externally (never lost)
- Better performance (CDN)
- Unlimited capacity
- Professional reliability
